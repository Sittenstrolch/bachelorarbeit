\section{Conclusion}
This thesis presented an approach to group companies, evaluate different clusters regarding
to their need development and predict demands of companies.

This thesis could not give the final answer to the problem, it is further more a
proof of concept that the primary objective to identify and current and future product
needs is possible.

The opportunities are promising. Knowing companie's demands beforehand would create a big
advantage to the ones using it.

\section{Future Work}
As this thesis is more a proof of concept than a final solution the main aspect of the
future work will be to improve the clustering by refering to more metrics as already mentionen
in section \ref{section:improvingResult}. Therefore it could be useful to also mention additional
datasources like the Compustat database which provides financial, statistical and market information
on companies throughout the world.

Another important part would be to enable the tool to work on huge datasets and implement the prediction
part to gain value from the obtained conclusions.
