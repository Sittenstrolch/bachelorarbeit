\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Outline}

Nowadays, as economy has passed boundaries and not only people but also companies are connected throughout the world,
it has become impossible to keep track of everything. Companies interact with each other in lots of different ways like
being competitors, exchanging employees, using the same infrastructure and more. Some of these influences may create
similar struggles or needs for these businesses. Due to the growing presence of businesses online, especially
social media platforms can be used to analyze companies behaviour.

So far webtechnologies enable us to extract product relevant posts, which express a demand,
from social media networks for certain products. Using this information a sales representative can
actively engage with a new customer. This thesis is going to present an approach that is based on the assumption
that similar or strongly related businesses develop similar product needs. We are going to prove this assumption,
explore existing correlations and develop a strategy to identify future claims.
